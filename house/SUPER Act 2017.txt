>                    2 (a) FINDINGS .—Congress makes the following find3 ings:
>                    4 (1) Carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to
>                    5 account for 40 to 45 percent of anthropogenic radi6 ative forcing (or manmade global warming), while
>                    7 the remainder is driven by non-carbon dioxide cli8 mate pollutants, primarily shortlived climate pollut9 ants. These shortlived climate pollutants, or ‘‘super
>                   10 pollutants’’, have shorter atmospheric lifespans than
>                   11 carbon dioxide, but cause about 25 to 2000 times
>                   12 more warming per ton over a 25 to 100 year period,
>                   13 and in many cases the emissions are growing much
>                   14 faster than carbon dioxide.
>                   15 (2) Several of the shortlived climate pollutants
>                   16 are also potent air pollutants that harm human
>                   17 health and reduce crop yields. Reducing these pollut18 ants can save thousands of lives every year in the
>                   19 United States and prevent millions of premature
>                   20 deaths from air pollution worldwide, while also in21 creasing agricultural production.
>                   22 (3) International efforts to address shortlived
>                   23 climate pollutants are underway, including the Cli24 mate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce ShortLived
