>                                   The honorable Senator lays down the first proposition:

>                                   Thereupon he calls attention to the alluring promises made

>                                torically that wars followed and not peace. He argued by

>                                of high purposes did not produce peace but war, and therefore
>                                that the declaration of purposes found in the present covenant
>                                of the league of nations would naturally be followed by war,
